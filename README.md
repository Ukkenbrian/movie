A short bit of code to connect to a sqlite db and run a query.

## About the datastore

This is a database of the top 250 movies from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). For simplicity's sake, it is not fully normalized. We won't be using this particular dataset during your onsite, but you can use it to familiarize yourself with SQLite and make sure you can access it from your preferred language.

Some steps to take

1. Make sure you have sqlite3 installed to explore sqlite db before running this code
2. Read the `main.py` file
3. Run the `main.py` file (`python main.py`)
